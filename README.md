# Maximum Protection repo -- last update 07/04/2021

## Idea

Maximum Protection(tm) is a vertical platformer where you're constantly being chased by a projectile-shooting enemy. The camera will also move upwards so the player is forced to keep moving. 

There is a power-up the player can grab which bounces the projectiles back towards the enemy for a limited amount of time. 

If the enemy gets hit the player some event could be triggered like 

- the camera could move a bit slower
- the enemy could stop firing a few seconds
- ...

The player wins when he reaches a certain checkpoint or when he collects a certain number of power-ups.

## Theme 

The theme of this game is knights and dragons/goblins or other creatures. The background of the game is currently a dark village, but maybe we'll add new backgrounds to it.
